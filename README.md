# Case study : facial detection and recognition with Python

This repository contains a work made for a Computer Vision course at the *Ecole Centrale de Lille*.

Its aim is to detect and recognize each face, firstly of an image, then of a video.
As an example, I used pictures of celebrities.

## News

In this section I will write the different steps of my work.

### Firstly 

I started with a simple database containing 30 pictures of Emma Stone, as much of Ryan Gosling, and 30 pictures of different celebrities labeled as "unknown". The extract_embeddings.py script firstly creates embeddings, which are vectors describing the "face's properties", then a Support Vector Machine model is trained to classify the celebrities.
It shows some good results (see the example above), but there are some errors : the results seem to be quite sensitive to the face's alignment.

Moreover, the model seems to struggle more with female faces, as quite a lot of female "unknown" faces are classified as Emma Stone's.

In the future, I shall expand my database for each class and implement a face alignment script to tackle the related trouble.

This code has been implemented based on [this tutorial](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/) written by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://github.com/jrosebr1), whose very good content has been quite helpful for me.
